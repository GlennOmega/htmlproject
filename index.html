                <h2>HTML-The Foundation of the Web</h2>
                <h4>Posted by Glenn Omega</h4>
                <p>HTML <strong>(Hypertext Markup Language)</strong> is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behavior (JavaScript).</p>
                <p>"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a <em>fundamental aspect</em> of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.</p>

                <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
                <p>HTML stands for HyperTextMarkup Language. It is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.</p>
                <p>HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video, etc. Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.</p>
                <p>The Main Parts of Elements are as Follows</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The opening tag</li>
                    <li>The closing tag</li>
                    <li>The content</li>
                    <li>The element</li>
                </ol>
